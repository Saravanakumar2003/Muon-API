    </header>

    <section id="what-is-it">
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Muons are elementary particles similar to electrons, with an electric charge of -1 e and a spin of 1/2, but with a much greater mass. They belong to the second generation of leptons in the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="origin">
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Muons are produced in high-energy collisions, such as those between cosmic rays and atomic nuclei in the Earth's atmosphere. They can also be generated in particle accelerators.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="basic-physics">
        <h2>Basic Physics</h2>
        <p>Muons are unstable particles with a mean lifetime of 2.2 microseconds. They decay into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. Due to their high mass compared to electrons, they lose energy more slowly when passing through matter, allowing them to penetrate deeper.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>Muons have several advantages in scientific research. Their ability to penetrate deep into materials makes them useful for probing the interior of objects, such as geological structures and archaeological sites. They are also used in particle physics experiments to study fundamental interactions.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="disadvantages">
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <p>The main disadvantage of muons is their short lifespan, which limits their practical applications. Additionally, generating muons requires high-energy processes, making it challenging and expensive to produce them in large quantities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>Muons have a range of applications in various fields. In particle physics, they are used to investigate the properties of other particles. In geology and archaeology, muon tomography helps visualize the internal structure of large objects. They also have potential applications in medical imaging and security scanning.</p>
